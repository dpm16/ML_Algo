This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to control Pacman.  To
select an agent, use the '-p' option when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be
passed to your agent using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the project
description.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the
    heuristic, there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can
    use. For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that
    value, try: problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'] = problem.walls.count()
    Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access
    problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount']

    #No matter where pacman is, it will have to move at least that distance to have eaten all hte food
    #To speed up compute time we use A* search to find the real distance between pacman and the furthest food

    #This heuristic is:
    #1. Non-triviale
    #   This distance between Pacman and the furthest food changes and is not null


    #2. Admissible
    #   This heuristic never over-estimates the cost of an action because even if all the food
    #   is perfectly lined up, Parcman will still have to move to the furthest away pellet

    #3. Consistante

    #   pellets of food are the same real distance away
